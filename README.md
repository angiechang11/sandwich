# Sandwich Ingredient Identification

My project helps people who have many foods they are allergic to or dislike. Using AI, my project helps cut down on the time and effort dedicated to finding something to eat.

Though I hope to expand on this project, it currently only classfies sandwiches as either having tomatoes and eggs ("deluxe"), having tomatoes ("veggie"), or having neither ("plain").
